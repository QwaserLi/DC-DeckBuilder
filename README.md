# DC-DeckBuilder

An attempt to remake a digital version of the DC deck building game made by Cryptozoic Entertainment. 
The current state is that it there are 2 players that can draw cards and purchase cards from the purchase deck, but power(the games
currency used to buy cards) has not been implemented.

There is a bug at the moment where after buying cards you might not draw the right amount of cards in the following turn.

THIS PROJECT HAS BEEN DROPPED FOR PERSONAL REASONS.
